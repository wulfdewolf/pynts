# Python Neural Tuning Scores

`pynts` is a light-weight python library to compute tuning scores for neuroscientific data.
It relies heavily on [`pynapple`](pynapple.org). For the moment it focuses on tuning scores for 
investigating spatial cognition.

We do not have a `pip` wheel yet. To install `pynts`, use:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/wulfdewolf/pynts.git
```
